See [Release Notes][release_notes]
__<The entire document should be one to two pages long. We will write each analysis document as if it is a conversation with a future developer. This requires a good writing style, with full sentences organized into paragraphs. Bullets are acceptable only for visual style, not as an excuse for writing sentence fragments.>__

== Overview

__<Define the requirement here. Be clear and succinct, you should be able to clearly define the context or problem in two or three paragraphs (if not sentences). Try to define the problem in the overall context and not to get into too much technical detail at this point.>__

=== User Stories

__<Provide one or more brief user stories that illustrate the intended users of
 the feature and the goal they will seek to achieve by using the feature.>__

== Issue Metadata

=== Related Issues

__<List the issues related to this feature>__

=== Affected Projects or Components

__<List the projects or components that are affected by the feature. List them using their Git repositories.>__

=== Other Interested Projects

=== Relevant Installation Types

__<List the installation types that are relevant for the features and remove any that are not relevant>__.

* Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)
* Managed domain
* OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I)
* Bootable jar

== Requirements

__<Describe the requirements that must be fulfilled by this feature.>__

__<For analyses of a promotion of an existing feature to
'preview' or 'community' stability, only list new requirements; existing
 requirements from the feature being promoted are assumed to continue unless
 otherwise noted in the 'Changed requirements' section. Other analyses, including
 those for promotion to the 'default' stability level, must list all requirements.>__

=== Changed requirements

__<Only relevant for analyses of a promotion of an existing feature to
 'preview' or 'community stability. Other analyses should remove this section.>__

__<For any existing requirements from the feature being promoted that are
 being changed or removed, describe the change.>__


=== Non-Requirements

__<Use this section to explicitly discuss things that readers might think are required but which are not required.>__ 

=== Future Work

__<Use this section to discuss requirements that are not addressed by this proposal but which may be addressed in later proposals.>__

== Backwards Compatibility

__<Does this enhancement affect backwards compatibility with previously released versions of WildFly? Can the identified incompatibility be avoided?>__

=== Default Configuration

__<Does the proposed work change the default value of any current configuration attributes? Does it change the configuration generated by any current Galleon layers?>__

=== Importing Existing Configuration

__<Does the proposed work affect the ability to run WildFly running an existing configuration? Is there anything else about the proposed work that may require changes to the WildFly server migration tool?>__

=== Deployments

__<Does this feature change the behavior of deployments in incompatible ways? If yes please detail what is the deployment issue observed when no change is done, and what is the change needed to solve the deployment issue>__

=== Interoperability

__<Is this feature impacting interoperability?>__

== Implementation Plan

__<This section is optional. If you have a complex feature which can not be delivered all in one go, suggest the strategy.>__

== Admin Clients

__<Identify the level of compatibility this feature will have with the existing admin clients (JBoss CLI and the Admin Console / HAL). Identify any follow up work that will be required in the clients and link issues created to track this work.>__

== Security Considerations

__<What impact on security does this feature have?>__

[[test_plan]]
== Test Plan

__<Depending on the selected stability level, the appropriate section below should be completed, including a brief description of how testing is to be performed in accordance with the selected stability level. The non-relevant sections may be removed as needed.>__
////
Depending on the stability level, the test plan required may vary. see below:
////

** Experimental - No test plan is required. Basic unit / integration tests should be added during development.

** Preview - a brief high-level description of the testing approach should be added here, including types of tests added (unit, integration, smoke, component, subsystem, etc.) Note that not all test types are required for a particular feature, so include a description of what is being tested and the approach chosen to perform the testing.

** Community - this level should include everything in the 'Preview' stability level, plus the following additional testing as relevant:
*** Manual tests: briefly describe checks to be performed during one-time exploratory testing. The purpose of this testing is to check corner cases and other cases that are not worth implementing as automated tests. Typical checks are: bad configurations are easy to reveal, attribute descriptions and error messages are clear, names are descriptive and consistent with similar resources, default values are reasonable.
*** Miscellaneous checks: Manual checks for significant changes in server performance, memory and disk footprint should be described here. These checks are not always relevant, but consideration of these impacts, and others, are strongly encouraged and should be described here. Fully qualified test case names should be provided along with a brief description of what the test is doing.
*** Integration tests - at the 'Community' stability level, complete integration tests should be provided.
*** Compatibility tests - if backwards compatibility is relevant to the feature, then describe how the testing is performed.

** Default - This stability level is reserved and requires approval by a professional Quality Engineer with subject matter expertise.

== Community Documentation

__<Describe how this feature will be documented or illustrated. Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly main, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the feature will bring additional content (such as quickstarts, guides, etc.). Indicate which of these will happen>__
 +** Default - This stability level is reserved and requires approval by a professional Quality Engineer with subject matter expertise.
 
== Release Note Content

__<Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the Release Note blog article for the release that first includes this feature.__
__Example article: https://www.wildfly.org/news/2024/01/25/WildFly31-Released/.__
__This content will be edited, so there is no need to make it perfect or discuss what release it appears in.>__
